## About Notate

Notate is an open-source note-taking application engineered specifically for **Onyx Boox E-Ink devices**.
The app implements a clean UI to streamline handwritten note-taking, with a focus on **performance** and **ergonomics**
without sacrificing extensive functionality.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ⚡ **Zero-Latency Input** | Leverages the Onyx `EpdController` to write directly to the hardware frame buffer |
| ♾️ **Infinite Canvas** | An endless workspace with zoom from 1% to 1000% using tiles + level-of-detail optimizations |
| 📐 **Shape Recognition** | Draw and hold to snap rough strokes into perfect geometric shapes:  lines, triangles, rectangles, circles, pentagons, hexagons |
| 📄 **Backgrounds** | Blank, ruled, grid, or dots—customizable spacing, thickness, color, and padding |
| ✏️ **Scribble-to-Erase** | Quickly erase content by scribbling over it—detects zig-zag gesture density and velocity |
| 🧴 **Smart Erasers** | Stroke eraser, standard (partial) eraser, and lasso eraser modes |
| 📝 **Images** | Paste images seamlessly into the canvas |
| 🔗 **Deep Linking** | Create interactive links to other notes, local PDFs, or websites; content opens in draggable floating windows |
| 🔲 **Selection** | Rectangle and lasso selection modes to select, copy, and move strokes or images |
| 🧭 **Fixed Pages Mode** | Page Mode emulation with visual grid and thumbnail navigation |
| 🎨 **Deep Customization** | Pen styles (Fountain, Ballpoint, Fineliner, Highlighter, Brush, Charcoal), colors, and stroke sizes |
| 🛠️ **Customizable Toolbar** | Add, remove, and reorder toolbar items; supports collapsible auto-hide mode |
| ⏪ **Undo/Redo** | Unlimited undo/redo history |
| 📁 **Project Organization** | File browser with projects, folders, thumbnails, rename, duplicate, and delete |
| 🗺️ **Minimap** | Overview minimap showing viewport position within the canvas |
| 📱 **Beautiful UI** | A clean, intuitive interface with floating toolbars and sidebar |
| 📐 **Drawing Aids** | Angle snapping and axis locking for precise lines |
| 📤 **Export & Share** | Export to PDF (vector or raster) and share directly |
| ☁️ **Cloud Sync** | Google Drive / WebDAV integration with optional PDF sync |

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

For developers interested in E-Ink optimization, Notate employs several key patterns:

### Spatial Partitioning
Uses a **Quadtree** (`util/Quadtree.kt`) to manage stroke visibility, ensuring O(log N) query performance even with thousands of strokes.

### Ghosting Control
Automatically switches between eink different update mods to ensure smooth rendering on E-Ink displays.

### Tiled Rendering
The `TileManager` implements Level-of-Detail (LOD) with cached bitmap tiles, allowing smooth zooming across a virtually infinite canvas.

### Concurrency
Heavy tasks like tile generation and shape recognition run on dedicated `ThreadPoolExecutors` to keep the UI thread responsive.

### Key Classes

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `InfiniteCanvasModel` | Core data model with thread-safe stroke storage |
| `TileManager` | LOD-based tile caching and rendering |
| `Quadtree` | Spatial indexing for efficient stroke queries |
| `ShapeRecognizer` | Geometry recognition using Douglas-Peucker + competitive scoring |
| `ScribbleDetector` | Gesture analysis for scribble-to-erase |
| `PenInputHandler` | Input processing with dwell detection |
